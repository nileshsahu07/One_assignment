           <p>Answer-1 = The virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the DOM. It is used in declaration web frameworks like React,Veu.js and Elm. It is important for performance optimization because it is much faster than Real DOM. </p> 

           <p>Answer-2 = Object manipulation is less time-consuming in ES6. In ES5, both function and return keywords are used to define a function. An arrow function is a new feature introduced in ES6 by which we don't require the function keyword to define the function. It provides a smaller range of community support than ES5 </p>

           <p>Answer-3 = Create React App - First of all we create a new file and open it in Vs Code and then open a new terminal then have to write "npx create-react-app" and then folder name as "myApp"  in terminal for download the app and then enter and downloading will start it takes some time to download when it will have downloaded then we have to write "cd then folder name" and then "npm start" for open it on browser then it will start. </p>

           <p>Answer-4 = JSX full form is JavaScript Syntax Extension .JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.4</p>

           <p>Answer-5 = React's handling of component-based architecture allows developers to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code. The benefits of this approach include better code organization, improved collaboration, increased productivity, and, ultimately, more efficient and reliable applications.</p>

           <p>Answer-6 = Functional components do not have a state or lifecycle methods. Class components have a state and can implement lifecycle methods like componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. Faster as they do not have state and lifecycle, react needs to do less work to render these components.</p>

           <p>Answer-7 = Props is a special keyword in React that stands for properties and is used for passing data from one component to another. Data with props are passed in a unidirectional flow from parent to child. Example is in Useprops.jsx</p>

           <p>Answer-8 = The key prop is a unique identifier that React uses to efficiently manage and update elements within a list. When rendering a list of elements, it is important to assign a unique key to each element to help React differentiate between the items and perform updates more efficiently.</p>

           <p>Answer-9 = Arrow function is short way of writing JavaScript functions in shorter way. Arrow functions were introduced in the ES6 version. They make our code more structured and readable. Arrow functions are anonymous functions i.e. functions without a name but they are often assigned to any variable. Example is in Arrowfun.jsx</p>

           <p>Answer-10 = Stateful components track changing data, while stateless components render the same thing or print out what is given to them. Stateful components are more complex and dependent on their state. Stateless components are simpler and not dependent on any state. 
           </p>

           <p>Answer-11 = Components in React go through a lifecycle of events, namely:<br></br><br></br>

            Mounting: - This is when a component is first created and inserted into the DOM.<br></br>
            Updating: - This occurs when a component's state or props change.<br></br>
            Unmounting: - This is when a component is removed from the DOM.<br></br><br></br>

            Each phase of the component lifecycle has its own set of lifecycle methods that are called at specific times.These methods allow you to perform certain tasks, such as fetching data, updating the DOM, and cleaning up resources.</p>

            <p>Answer-12 is in Simplecom.jsx</p>

            <p>Answer-13 is in Fcom.jsx</p>

            <p>Answer-14 is in Ccom.jsx</p>

            <p>Answer-15 and 16 example is also in Useprops.jsx</p>
